Most of the tutorials are written so they only depend of a few other tutorials, so you don't have to read all of them, but if you're completely new to shaders I recommend you to read the first few in order no matter what you'll do after that.

If you don't understand those tutorials here, please message me so I can make them more accessible!

1. [Structure]({{< ref "001-structure" >}}):
   - Here I explain the base structure of most modern shaders and how its described in ShaderLab.
2. [HLSL]({{< ref "002-hlsl" >}}):
   - This Tutorial explains most of hlsl.
3. [Variables]({{< ref "003-variables" >}}):
   - This is a short explanation of which variables a basic shader needs and what coordinate spaces are.
4. [Basic Shader]({{< ref "004-basic" >}}):
   - And in this one we can finally combine that knowledge to make a fully functional shader.
