title: Shader Tutorials by Ronja
---

Hey there, I'm Ronja and I make shader tutorials with the goal to make shaders understandable by everyone. 
The focus of this tutorials is on unity shaders with hlsl. They are more accessible than direct implementations of the shader APIs yet flexible and powerful. Even though they're all in one (proprietary) engine most of the skills I teach are transferrable to other contexts. If you have any wishes for shaders you want to know how they work write me a message and I'll see what I can do.

The tutorials do assume that you know how to program in any written programming language (which one doesnt matter), so its better to start there. If you're completely new to shaders I recommend your start with the series about the absolute basics, explaining how to make a very simple shader from nothing, you can find it [here](/basics.html).

You can also find me on twitter at [@totallyRonja](https://www.twitter.com/totallyRonja). If you like what I do and want to support me you can do that on Patreon (<https://www.patreon.com/RonjaTutorials>) or use Ko-Fi for one-time donations (<https://ko-fi.com/ronjatutorials>).
